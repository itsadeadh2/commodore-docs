Languages and tools

## Language/Framework

The REST API is built with **[Python 3.12.4](https://www.python.org/)** and **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)**.

### Why Python and Flask?

- **Python**: Chosen because it's the language I've been using the most recently. Its simplicity and readability make development faster and more efficient.
- **Flask**: Selected to refresh my knowledge. Flask is lightweight and less opinionated compared to Django, providing more flexibility for experimenting with architectural patterns and handling features like authentication independently.

## Tools

The tools used in the development process include:
1. `unittest` - For automated tests.
2. `coverage` - For test coverage reports.
3. `flake8` - For linting.
4. **Docker** - For containerization.
5. **AWS** - For deployment.
6. **GitHub** - For version control.
7. **GitHub Actions** - For CI/CD.
