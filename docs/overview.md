# Introduction

:::warning[No longer deployed]
Commodore Landing turned out to be a very expensive side project.
As of today (July 01, 2024) it is no longer deployed on aws.

I am currently looking for ways to reduce the cost of the underlying infrastructure,
specially the load balancers/nat gateway setup. If I do manage to get it to be less expensive, then
the apps may get re-deployed.

## Why?

I created **[Commodore Landing](https://itsadeadh2.com/home)** to serve as my personal portfolio and to host my
pet projects. As a backend developer, it is often challenging to showcase skills in an engaging way similar
to frontend developers. **[Commodore Landing](https://itsadeadh2.com/home)** aims to bridge that gap..

## How does it work?

The **[Commodore Landing](https://itsadeadh2.com)** project is a React app that serves as a landing page for 
my personal website (https://itsadeadh2.com/home).
  
**However**, it is also part of a larger microservices architecture that hosts many other apps. While "Commodore Landing"
refers to this specific project, I also use the term to describe the entire microservices architecture.
